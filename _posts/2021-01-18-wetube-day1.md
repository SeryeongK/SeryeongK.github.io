### NodeJS
: Javascript outside of the browser (with Javascript)

### Why

- to make frontend and backend with javascript
- good when you need to handle data (not for hardcore processing, hardware)
- if you want to build real-time situation

* backend - PHP, Ruby, Python(Django)

There's only one programming language of the frontend: Javascript

There are many programming language of the backend

### Features

- there's nothing
- like a lego set that I can build piece by piece (cf. Django is like a big toy that I have to learn how to use)
- great for real-tme applications (ex) Uber's recording the GPS locations of the drivers)
- great for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications
- not good for hardware intensive applications
